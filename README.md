## Stack choices 📦
### Libraries 📕
* [Native-base](https://nativebase.io)
* [React-native-maps](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-maps)
* [Google maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation)
* [React-native-geocoding](https://github.com/marlove/react-native-geocoding)


#### Why React Native?
 React Native isn't necessary better than standard Native development. But React Native's main advantage compared to Native is enabling single JavaScript codebase for 2 different platforms. Furthermore, not only is it easier to maintain the app for both platforms, but also it requires less resources.

#### Why Native-base?
 Native-base gives you the potential of building applications that run on iOS and Android using a single codebase. It eases out your development. Since NativeBase is built on top of React Native, hence with any component you can pass the style property which will be merged to the default style of that component.

#### Why React-native-maps?
 React-native-maps is Having accurate information about your users’ location is a great way to enhance the user experience. For example, you could use this data to show users what is around them, offer exclusive deals for products and services in their area, and much more. Fortunately, if you have a React application, implementing maps is a breeze using the react-native-maps library.

#### Why Google maps API?
 Google maps API is a robust tool that can be used to create a custom map, a searchable map, check-in functions, display live data synching with location, plan routes, or create a mashup just to name a few.

#### Why React-native-geocoding?
 React-native-geocoding module for React Native to transform a description of a location (i.e. street address, town name, etc.) into geographic coordinates (i.e. latitude and longitude) and vice versa. This module uses Google Maps Geocoding API and requires an API key for purposes of quota management. It saves a considerable amount of time to create a localisation.

## API 🧐

### Définition
An API is used to make the data or functionality of an existing application available for use by other applications. Here is who should make the notion of application programming interface clearer 😊
